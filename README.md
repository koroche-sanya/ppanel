# PPanel - Change Frame Border
PPanel is a powerful tool for changing the frame border of your Processing sketch. It comes with pre-installed themes for the frame border, such as MacOS frames, Windows frames, or your own custom themes!
# How to Install PPanel
To install PPanel, download it from the 'Releases' section. The default release includes PPanel, BasePlane, ModernPlane, MacOSPlane, and Win95Plane. After downloading, import the library as a .zip archive.
# How to create my own theme?
To create your own theme, you need to create a new file with a .java extension. Next, create a 'public class' with the same name as the file. This class needs to extend the 'krcsn.ppanel.panels.BasePlane' or any other panel from the 'panels' package. After creating the class, override the necessary functions and create your own implementations. Then, instantiate the class in the main sketch. Check for bugs and fix them if needed. Congratulations, your theme is created!
